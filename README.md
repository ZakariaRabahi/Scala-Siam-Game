## [Siam Project](https://github.com/yourusername/SiamProject)

The **Siam Project** is a strategic board game implemented in **Scala**. The game allows two players to engage in a turn-based competition to move pieces on a grid and achieve victory by pushing a neutral object off the board. This project emphasizes both game logic and the use of functional programming paradigms provided by Scala.

### Features:
- Implements the full **Siam** game, where players compete to push a rock off the board using their animal pieces.
- Turn-based mechanics with interactive and strategic elements.
- Comprehensive grid management to handle player moves, piece interaction, and object manipulation.

### Technologies Used:
- **Scala**: The core game logic is written in Scala, leveraging both object-oriented and functional programming techniques.
- **SiamGrid.scala**: This file manages the game grid, where all piece movement and interactions are handled.
- **siam.scala**: Contains the main logic for the Siam game, including the rules for piece movement, win conditions, and gameplay flow.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- Developed a deeper understanding of functional programming concepts using **Scala**.
- Implemented a complex game board system, focusing on handling player interactions and grid updates efficiently.
- Gained experience in designing and implementing a turn-based game from scratch.
- Improved problem-solving skills by tackling strategic elements and game logic.
